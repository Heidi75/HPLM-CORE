# HPLM Core (Hybrid Pyramid Logic Model)

This repository houses the **Master Key** infrastructure for the 7-Layer HPLM. 
It is a universal **Truth Engine** designed to solve the "Hallucination Problem" 
in critical industries like Fintech, Physics (ENEG), and Medicine.

## The 7-Layer Stack
1. **NIL (Neural Intake):** Linguistic Interface for messy reality.
2. **FTL (Formalization):** Translates text into Rigid Variables.
3. **DSS (Domain Solvers):** Non-neural math engines (Newtonian/Financial).
4. **Symbolic Arena:** The Truth Engine. Performs Dimensional Analysis.
5. **Deontic Veto Gate:** Hard-stops hallucinations before they reach the user.
6. **TAL (Traceback & Audit):** Forensic logs for 100% transparency.
7. **ADL (Action & Deployment):** The verified "Safe Harbor" output.

## Engineering Philosophy
"Neural layers interpret; Symbolic layers verify."
